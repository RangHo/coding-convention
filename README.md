# RangHo's No-nonexistent-nonsense Coding Conventions

Coding conventions are important. It ensures consistency of codes, which in turn ensures less pain in the ass when debugging, or even refactoring altogether. This alone is a pretty convincing reason to create and follow a convention.

However, as we all know, the *real* reason why we use coding conventions is that we all have OCD, and thus we get triggered occasionally by:

 1. misaligned indentations (though Python kinda enforces indentations);
 2. tab characters and 4-spaces all mixed up like some sort of crappy veggie soup;
 3. massive tab spaces (I am sorry Linux Kernel developers, 8-col tab is just hella too long);
 4. inconsistent spellings (and yes, I am indirectly referring to Unity `MonoBehaviour` class);
 5. `camelCase` vs. `PascalCase` vs.`snake_case` vs. `SCREAMING_CASE` a.k.a. *the* hot potato of all programmers bullshit;
 6. and many many more.

That is basically me getting triggered at my own code, thanks.
